Hello, my name is Ricardo i live in Brazil and i have huge passion for software security and i am always following the latest security technologies, specially in the game industry.
I've been doing this all my life really but in the last 5+ years i had real experience, in both sides, working with anti-cheat solutions and with anti-cheat exploitating as well.
